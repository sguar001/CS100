This is my final project for my CS120B class. It is a Lexical Analyzer that displays an LED emoji on an 8x8 LED Matrix, based on an inputted string that is received over Bluetooth from an Android device. The microcontroller analyzes the received string (over USART) to determine the mood of the sender, then displays the emoji accordingly. The complete parts list and a detailed report are on this repo.
